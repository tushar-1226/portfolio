# Overview

This paper examines production integration patterns for Large Language Models (LLMs) including request routing, caching strategies, guardrails, and observability.

## Patterns

### 1. Request Orchestration

- Centralized control over provider selection and retries
- Cost-aware routing and load balancing

### 2. Caching & Memoization

- Cache prompts and responses for common queries
- Semantic caching using embeddings

### 3. Guardrails & Validation

- Prompt sanitization and output validation
- Safety filters and content policies

### 4. Observability

- Trace requests and model usage
- Log prompts and responses with metadata

### 5. Fine-Tuning & Adapters

- Use LoRA/adapters for domain-specific tasks
- Manage versions and rollbacks

### 6. Multi-Model Fallbacks

- Automatic fallback on failures/timeouts
- A/B testing across providers

## Emerging Trends

- Better context management for long conversations
- Efficient fine-tuning methods
- Reduced hallucination rates

## Conclusion

Integrating LLMs in production requires thoughtful architecture, robust engineering, and continuous monitoring. The patterns outlined here provide a foundation for building reliable, scalable, and cost-effective LLM-powered applications.

Success lies in choosing the right pattern for your use case, implementing proper safeguards, and continuously optimizing based on real-world performance data.
